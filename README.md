🤖 Talking Robotic Hand
  Hello everyone! I'm building a robotic hand that can talk to you — just like Jarvis!
  No more buttons or complex controllers. You simply ask it, and it does the job — from picking and placing objects to handling various household tasks, depending on the       gripper attached.

✨ Project Vision
  This robotic hand aims to revolutionize how we interact with machines:
    💬 Voice-controlled: No need for remote controls — just use your voice.
    🦾 Multi-purpose Gripper: Adaptable for various household and industrial tasks.
    🏥 Industrial & Medical Use: Can assist in farming, medical operations, and other fields where precision and haptic feedback matter.
    🧠 Smart Interaction: Integrates computer vision and AI to understand tasks and environments.

🧑‍💻 About Me
  I’m currently the sole developer of this project.
  I handle everything from:
  Mechanical design & 3D printing
  Torque testing & servo selection
  Power management & electronics
  Programming (AI, control logic, voice interaction)
