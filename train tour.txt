📋 Project Steps
Step 1:
  data.py is used to collect images using the camera and also label them manually. You have to do this first.

Step 2:
  Convert the XML label files to YOLO format (.txt files).

Step 3:
  Train the model using the images and labels by running yolo_train.py.

Step 4:
  Use the trained model for detection by running box_detection.py.

Step 5:
  First, upload and run final_data_input_control.ino to establish UART communication between the Arduino microcontroller and the system's       Python script.
  Then, run jeerymulti.py to start the robot.

⚠️ Note: Some of these files are not yet uploaded to this GitHub repository. But I have them.
